# Az-JWT-Microservice
* I have created three microservices:
    - `az-jwt-example` for required assignment.
    - `az-jwt-example-test` for BDD testing.
    - `az-jwt-example-client` for client (not completed fully)
* I have used `H2` in memory DB to have one user detail so that we can easily test functionality.
* Both microservice have their on `README.md` file, please have a look.
* I tried my best to share production ready code, so I have covered Unit testing and BDD Testing as well.
